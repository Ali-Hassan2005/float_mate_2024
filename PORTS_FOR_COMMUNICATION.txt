PORTS FOR COMMUNICATION BETWEEN ESP AND ARDUINO NANO

ESP : 
	PORT1 : Send 'M', 'C'
			----> 'M' here is to get a reading on PORT2, 
				and 'C' is to initiate a calibration
				for ZeroDepth and ZeroPressure above the pool we'll use

	PORT2 : Recieve Measurement Data for Depth and Pressure
NANO : 
	PORT1 : Send Measurement Data "P + 100.70", "D + 0.01"
			----> P' here is to denote Pressure readings and 'D' for Depth 					readings, and recieve calibration values for PZero and DZero

	PORT2 : Recieve Instructions from ESP




----> NANO SIDE IS DONE "NOT SURE THO"
----> ESP SIDE IS MISSING SOME STUFF + THE ESP CODE SHOULD ALSO BE ADDED TO THE MAIN CODE
